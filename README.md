In this project I would like to adjust adeept rasptank in order to be more inteligent - if you have some ideas, please araise them and I hope that together we can make super robots out of our Adeept rasptanks!
For a time being it would be:
1) following certain color including left and right move (not only camera up and down)
2) added random movements in order to explore room seeking for new colorful object
3) adding some automated arm movements - in progress
4) moving close to the color object and try to grab it - in progress

In the future I would like to build a robot which removes green plants from pavements:
1) objects recognition - plants on pavement - need to use some AI to process the camera view - maybe on some external server in order to save battery power?
2) inisipired by the company that removes plants by laser - investigate posibility to install laser on board
